# Associative Arrays

## Overview
This project implements an associative array data structure in Java, allowing for the storage and retrieval of key/value pairs. The primary goal is to understand the mechanics of associative arrays and practice implementing data structures from scratch.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Gain hands-on experience with data structures, specifically associative arrays.
- Learn to implement generics in Java.
- Develop skills in writing tests to ensure code correctness.
- Enhance collaboration skills using version control (Git).
